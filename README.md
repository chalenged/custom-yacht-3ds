# custom-yacht-3ds
A customizable yacht dice game for the 3ds using lovepotion

# Build
To run on computer, simply git clone the repository with <code>--recursive</code> and run the folder with love2d.
To build for the 3ds, follow the instructions from https://lovebrew.org/getting-started/get-lovepotion. I recommend using the bundler, so you don't have to deal with manually converting to t3x files and such.
